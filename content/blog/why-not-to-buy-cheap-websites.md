# Why a $20 Website Will Cost You Thousands in Lost Business

You found a deal. Someone offered to build your business website for $20. Sounds like a steal, right?

Here's what that $20 actually costs you.

## What a $20 Website Looks Like in Real Life

I built one intentionally to show you. Go ahead and try it:

**[20-dollar-restaurant.vercel.app](https://20-dollar-restaurant.vercel.app)**

Open it on your phone. Wait for it to load. Try to find the menu. Try to contact the business.

Done? Here's what you just experienced:

- **5+ seconds of blank screen** before anything appears
- **Placeholder text** like "Hello World" still on the page
- **Broken mobile layout** - buttons cut off, text unreadable
- **Links that go nowhere**
- **Generic WordPress template** with zero customization

That's what $20 buys you. Now imagine a potential customer clicking your link from Instagram or Google. They don't know you personally. They're judging whether to trust you with their money.

## The Real Cost: Customers You Never See

A bad website doesn't just look cheap - it actively repels customers.

### Trust is Everything

When someone visits your website, they're asking one question: *Is this a real business?*

A $20 website answers "no" before they read a single word.

Broken links, placeholder text, slow loading - these aren't just aesthetic problems. They're trust problems. And in business, trust is everything.

### The Mobile Problem

Most web traffic now comes from phones. A $20 website is built for desktop, tested once, and never checked again.

Your customers are browsing on their phones during lunch breaks, commutes, and couch time. If your site is broken on mobile, you're invisible to them.

### The Speed Problem

Nobody waits anymore. If your site takes 5 seconds to load, most visitors have already left. They hit the back button and clicked your competitor's link instead.

## What You're Actually Paying For

When you pay more than $20, here's what that money buys:

| Feature | $20 Website | $500+ Website |
|---------|-------------|---------------|
| Load Time | 5+ seconds | Under 1 second |
| Mobile Experience | Broken | Perfect on all devices |
| Customization | None - generic template | Branded to your business |
| Contact Info | Maybe correct | Clickable phone, map, forms |
| SEO | None | Optimized for Google |
| Trust Factor | Hurts your reputation | Builds credibility |

## The Hidden Problem: You'll Pay Twice

Here's the real trap of cheap websites.

You buy the $20 site. It doesn't work. Customers complain. You realize you need something better.

Now you're paying again - for the website you should have bought in the first place.

That $20 decision just cost you $520 instead of $500.

## When a $20 Website Makes Sense

To be fair, there are situations where a $20 website is fine:

- You're testing a business idea before committing
- You literally have zero budget and need something today
- You're a hobbyist, not a business

But if you're trying to build a real business with real customers, a $20 website is not a shortcut. It's a roadblock.

## A Better Alternative: Start With Google

If budget is tight, don't buy a $20 website. Set up a Google Business Profile instead.

It's free. It shows up in local searches. It displays your hours, photos, and reviews. Customers can call you with one tap.

A Google Business Profile with reviews will bring you more customers than a $20 website ever will.

## The Bottom Line

Your website is often the first thing customers see. It's either working for you or against you.

A $20 website works against you. It tells customers you don't care, you're not professional, and you might not even be a real business.

**The real cost isn't $20. It's every customer who clicked away.**

## See For Yourself

Don't take my word for it. Experience the difference:

- [$20 Restaurant Website](https://20-dollar-restaurant.vercel.app) - See what you're NOT getting
- [$20 Ecommerce Store](https://20-dollar-ecommerce-app.vercel.app) - See why customers won't buy

Open them on your phone. Time how long they take to load. Try to find contact information.

Then ask yourself: Would I trust this business with my money?

Your customers are asking the same question.
