# What a $100 Website Actually Gets You

You're not looking for a $20 disaster. You know that won't work. But $100? That feels reasonable. A premium WordPress theme, maybe some customization. Should be fine, right?

Here's what $100 actually delivers - nothing more, nothing less.

## Try It Yourself

I built both so you can see exactly what you're getting:

- [**$100 Restaurant Website**](https://100-dollar-restaurant.vercel.app)
- [**$100 Ecommerce Store**](https://100-dollar-ecommerce-app.vercel.app)

Open them on your phone. Browse the menu or products. Try the checkout.

Done? Let's talk about what you just experienced.

## What You Actually Get

Here's the fair assessment: a $100 website works. It loads (eventually). Products display. Contact info is visible. It's not broken like a $20 site.

**What works:**

- Products or menu items display correctly
- Basic navigation functions
- Your phone number and address are visible
- Looks professional enough at first glance
- Works on desktop, mostly works on mobile

For a side hustle or business just starting out, this isn't terrible. You have something to show people. You can put a link in your Instagram bio.

**The WhatsApp model is real.**

Many small businesses actually operate this way. Browse the catalog, message the seller on WhatsApp, negotiate price and payment. It's a legitimate model that works for low-volume sales.

But here's the thing - that model works because it's *intentional*. You're choosing direct communication. A $100 website forces you into that model whether you want it or not.

## Where It Breaks Down

A $100 site isn't broken. It's just limited. And those limits become problems fast.

**No automation.**

Orders come in through WhatsApp. You're manually tracking inventory in a spreadsheet. Payment happens through bank transfer or cash. Every customer interaction requires your direct involvement.

**No scaling.**

One viral Instagram post and you're drowning in messages. Twenty orders a day means twenty separate conversations. There's no system - just you, your phone, and an ever-growing list of unread messages.

**The template problem.**

You've seen this site before. Not this exact one, but dozens like it. The same colors, same layout, same generic structure. Your customers won't remember your site an hour later.

**Performance issues.**

Those beautiful product images? They take 4 seconds each to load. The homepage takes 5-8 seconds. On mobile data, it's worse. Most visitors won't wait.

## The Honest Verdict

A $100 website is a placeholder. It's "something online" - not an investment in your business.

It works if:

- You're testing a business idea before committing
- You sell low volume and don't mind manual work
- You need something today and have zero budget
- You genuinely prefer the WhatsApp ordering model

It doesn't work if:

- You're trying to look established
- You want customers to find you through Google
- You're competing with businesses that have real websites
- You expect the website to actually *do* anything

**Don't expect ROI from a $100 website.** It won't bring you customers. It won't save you time. At best, it's a digital business card - somewhere to send people who already know about you.

---

## The Upgrade Moment

How do you know when you've outgrown a $100 site?

**When you're spending more than 2 hours a week managing orders through WhatsApp.**

That's the signal. If customer messages are eating into your actual business - making products, serving customers, growing - then the money you "saved" on a website is costing you time.

Time you could spend on things that actually generate revenue.

Other signals:

- You've had customers complain about slow loading
- You're losing track of orders
- You're spending hours manually following up
- You're embarrassed to share your website link

## What Comes Next

If you've realized a $100 site won't cut it, here's what to look at:

**$500 tier** - This is where websites start working *for* you. Fast loading, proper mobile experience, actual checkout. The website becomes an employee, not just a poster.

## The Bottom Line

A $100 website gives you exactly what you pay for: something online.

It's not terrible. It's not great. It just *exists*.

If that's all you need right now, fine. But don't expect it to grow your business. Don't expect customers to be impressed. Don't expect it to save you time.

**A $100 website is a cost. A $500+ website is an investment.**

Know the difference before you spend.
